        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I always wanted to have a life log / tracker kinda thing which I can use to document my experiences/learnings - this blog is an effort towards that. Maybe, years later - I look at it and have a good laugh or maybe it helps someone, who knows :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s already 1am, I should head to bed probably. Kinda sad as I have to soon go back to college in Chennai (have to pack stuff in morning - have the train the next day). Will again miss being at home :(&lt;/p&gt;
